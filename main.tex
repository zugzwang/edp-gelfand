\title{The Gelfand Problem in Tubular Domains}

\maketitle


\abstract{
    We construct stable solutions of $\Delta u + \lambda e^u=0$ with
    Dirichlet boundary conditions in small tubular domains (i.e. geodesic
    $\ep$--neighbourhoods of a curve $\Lambda$ embedded in $\RR^n$), adapting
    the arguments of Pacard-Pacella-Sciunzi. We also show unicity of these
    solutions, in particular, we show that the stable branch of the bifurcation
    diagram is similar to the well-known nose-shaped diagram of the standard
    Gelfand problem in the unit ball. In this work, $\Lambda$ can be replaced
    by any compact smooth manifold embedded in $\RR^n$.

    % We construct multiple solutions of $\Delta u + \lambda e^u=0$ with
    % Dirichlet boundary conditions in small tubular domains (i.e. geodesic
    % $\ep$--neighbourhoods of a curve $\Lambda$ embedded in $\RR^n$), adapting
    % arguments of Pacard-Pacella-Sciunzi.  Moreover, in dimension less than 10
    % and $\ep$ outside a resonant set accumulating around 0, we construct
    % unstable solutions, proving that the bifurcation diagram of this problem is
    % similar to the nose-shaped diagram of the standard Gelfand problem in the
    % unit ball, for every dimension. In this work, $\Lambda$ can be replaced
    % by any compact smooth manifold embedded in $\RR^n$.
