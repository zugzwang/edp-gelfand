\section{Unstable solutions in $\RR^2$ and $\RR^3$}

In this section, we show that the preceding construction generalises to obtain
new solutions to the Liouville problem in the tube given an unstable solution to
the problem in the ball $B^{n-1}$. We know that, for $n\geq 11$, there is a
unique solution to the Liouville problem in $B^{n-1}$, which is stable, thus we
will not be led to new solutions. We therefore work in tubes embedded in
$\RR^n$ with $n=2,3$.

The key ingredient that allowed us to prove the existence of the stable solution
in the tube is the invertibility of the operator $L_\ep=-(\Delta_{\mathring
g}+\lambda e^{u_\ep})$, where we recall that $u_\ep$ is a copy of the solution
given by the Gidas-Ni-Nirenberg theorem in the unit ball. Assume $2\leq n\leq 3$
and $\Omega=B^{n-1}$. We know from Section~\ref{sec:ball} that, for every
$\lambda < \lambda^\ast(B^{n-1})$, there is only one solution other than the
stable one, which we note by $\tilde U$. In other words, $\tilde U$ solves
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:u-tilde}
\left\{
\begin{array}{cc}
\Delta \tilde U + \lambda e^{\tilde U}=0 & \mbox{ in }B^{n-1},\\
\tilde U = 0 &\mbox{ on }\partial B^{n-1}.
\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}

It is well-known that
$$
\mu_1(-\Delta-\lambda^\ast e^{u_\ast},B^{n-1})=0,
$$
where $u_\ast$ is the solution to $(L_\lambda^\ast)$ in the ball and $\mu_1$
stands for the least eigenvalue (see~\cite{stable-solutions-elliptic}, \S 2),
is the only case where the operator $-\Delta-\lambda^\ast e^{u_\ast}$ is
non-invertible for these dimensions. In this case, let us note, for any
$\lambda < \lambda^\ast$,
$$\mu_1<0<\mu_2\leq \mu_3\leq \cdots$$
the eigenvalues of the operator $-\Delta-\lambda e^{\tilde U}$ in the unit ball
$B^{n-1}$, and define as before $\tilde u_\ep:T_\ep\to\RR$ by $\tilde
u_\ep(y,z)=\tilde U\big(\frac{\operatorname{dist}(z,\Lambda)}{\ep}\big)$. The
negative eigenvalue $\mu_1$ is the source of a resonance phenomenon, forcing
to tweak part of the argument. Let us explain briefly: Note
$$0=\nu_1<\nu_2\leq\nu_3\leq\dots $$
the eigenvalues of $-\Delta_{\mathring g}$ on $\Lambda$. If we proceed as
before, the argument fails when trying to invert $\tilde
L_\ep:=-\ep^2\Delta+\lambda e^{\tilde u_\ep}$. Indeed, with a rescaling to work
in $T_1( \Lambda )$, this operator becomes $(-\Delta_{g_z}-\ep^2
\Delta_{\mathring g}-\ep D):=\hat L - \ep D$. Now, the eigenvalues of $\hat L$
are of the form $\mu_i+\ep^2\nu_j$, and as $\mu<0$, there exist values of $\ep$
such that $\hat L$ is non invertible. Let us note
$$
S:=\{\ep>0\,:\; \mu_1+\ep^2\nu_j=0,\, j\in \NN\}
$$
the set of such values of $\ep$. Even if we restrict $\ep\not\in S$, we will not
conclude at once the invertibility of $\tilde L_\ep$, because the fixed-point
theorem uses the fact that the norm of the inverse is controlled by
$1/\delta_\ep$, where $\delta_\ep$ is the distance from $0$ to the spectrum,
which was $\mu_1$ before. Here, we only have the bound
$$
\delta_\ep\leq\ep^2 \max_{1\leq j \leq k}(\nu_{j+1}-\nu_j),
$$
where $k$ is the index of the first eigenvalue of the spectrum
$(\nu_j)_{j\in\NN}$ such that $\mu_1+\ep^2\nu_k>0$. In particular, we will not
find a contraction mapping leading to the invertibility of $\tilde L_\ep$.

Let us first prove a partial result, and concentrate in $\tilde L_\ep$ afterwards.

\begin{theorem}
    Let $n=2,3$. For small enough $\ep$ and such that $\tilde L_\ep$ is
    invertible, there exist two solutions to
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq-thm-2-sols}
        \left\{
            \begin{array}{cc}
                \Delta u + \frac{\lambda}{\ep^2} e^u = 0 & \mbox{ in
                }T_\ep(\Lambda),\\
                    u=0 & \mbox{ on }\partial T_\ep(\Lambda).
                \end{array}
                \right.
    \end{equation}
    \end{theorem}
    \textit{Proof: } Define by analogy the functions $\tilde W, \tilde w_\ep$
    as supersolutions and prove the same estimates as before. The fact that
    $\tilde L_\ep$ is invertible ensures that we have elliptic estimates for
    $\tilde u_\ep, \tilde w_\ep$. To finish the construction, restate the
    problem~\ref{eq-thm-2-sols} as a fixed-point problem that can be easily
    solved as in the proof of theorem~\ref{thm:unique-stable-sol}, completing
    the proof.\hfill $\blacksquare$

    We have therefore proven that, in dimensions 2 and 3, there exist two
    solutions to the problem given that $\ep$ is away from the set of values
    that lead to resonance phenomena: the stable one discussed
    in~\ref{sec:stable-sol-in-tube} and the unstable one, with Morse index
    $\approx 1/\ep$.
