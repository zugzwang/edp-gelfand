\section{Concluding remarks}

In this article, we adapted the arguments
of~\cite{Pacard2014,stable-solutions-elliptic} to the Gelfand problem $\Delta u
+ \lambda e^u=0$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions in a small geodesic tube
around a smooth manifold embedded in $\RR^n$.
% As already stated in~\cite{Pacard2014},
We believe that the same line of thinking in~\cite{Pacard2014} can be
carried out without further complications here to complete the bifurcation diagram.
This is, to show that the unstable
solutions of the Gelfand problem in the unit ball can also be used to construct
unstable solutions in tubular domains, for $\ep$ possibly outside a set of
resonant values in which the linearized operator $-\Delta - \lambda e^{u_\ep}$
is not invertible, where $u_\ep$ is the rescaling of an unstable solution. Moreover,
an analogous spectral analysis of the linearized operator should yield the
Morse index of unstable solutions. This way, we expect the same resonance phenomena,
i.e., that the invertibility of linearized operators holds only for values of $\ep$
in a set accumulating around 0 (but not for every small $\ep>0$).
